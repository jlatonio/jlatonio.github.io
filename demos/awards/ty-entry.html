                            <p>Rudi is one of the most honest and direct people I have ever met. He makes everyone’s job much easier because he is so easy to work with. He genuinely cares about the Acrobat/Reader product, and does not cut corners when it comes to doing his work. He enjoys the challenge of his work, even when it isn’t easy. He also, however, makes it a point to treat everyone with respect. He is one person you can truly trust to offer intelligent, unbiased views and information.</p>

                            <p>Rupen has been highly innovative around helping to redesign the Flash player to work in a mobile environment. He has personally set the coding standards and review guidelines to ensure all developers on the team are building code that will be reliable enough to perform in an embedded system. In addition, Rupen has been working with me to brainstorm new ideas to tie in developer services to help Adobe monetize the Flash platform through services.</p>

                            <p>You can see in every action Alex takes that he keeps the customer experience in mind. Whether internal stakeholders or our external customers, Alex won’t settle for the status quo and looks for ways to continually drive improvement, and he works tirelessly to find better ways to do things. There was a clear external customer need, and Alex was able to address that issue while also solving a problem his colleagues were having. The original process was manual and resource intensive and Alex was able to ease their burden by devising a “set it and forget it” workflow. At the end of the day, he is concerned with delivering Exceptional experiences to anyone he interacts with.</p>

She has created an inclusive culture where people do their best work and maximize the contributions of the team. Maria is always reminding our teams about the customer and to put the customer first. She is also champion for the mission of our group and promotes collaboration among different groups in many different geos. Under her leadership, my group has seen a tremendous positive cultural shift over the years.</p>
